# AGENTS.md file For Whitney Houston Challenge project

## Setup commands
- use `pnpm install` when dependencies are missing or outdated

## Code style and conventions
- We use pure CSS only
- We can use browser API's like localstorage
- We use pure javascript and pure Vue when possible, with as little as possible extra npm packages

## Dev environment tips  
- Use `pnpm dev` to start the Vue dev server
- Check the name field inside each package's package.json to confirm the right name—skip the top-level one.  

## Testing instructions  
- There should not be any tests
- There is no CI

## Code quality
- Always run `pnpm lint` and `pnpm test` after changing files
